## Comments
In javascript, single line comments start with ```//```. While multi-line comments start with ```/*``` and end with ```/*```.

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data.

Javascript variables are declared via ```var```, ```let``` and ```const```. Where ```var``` can work for older version of JavaScript, ```const``` works from 2015 and the value of the variable cannot change, ```let``` works from 2015 and the value of the variable cannot change.

All JavaScript **variables** must be identified with **unique names**. These unique names are called **identifiers**.

JavaScript can add strings and numbers: ```let x = "5" + 2 + 3;``` will get ```523```.

## Operators
Javascript operators are very similar to other programming languages.
Things to notice:
- ```===``` - equal value and equal type
- ```!===``` - not equal value or not equal type
- ```?``` - ternary operator
- ```&&``` - logical and
- ```||``` - logical or
- ```!``` - logical not
- ```typeof``` - returns the type of a variable
- ```instanceof``` - returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
