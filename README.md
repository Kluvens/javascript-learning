## Comments
In javascript, single line comments start with ```//```. While multi-line comments start with ```/*``` and end with ```/*```.

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data.

Javascript variables are declared via ```var```, ```let``` and ```const```. Where ```var``` can work for older version of JavaScript, ```const``` works from 2015 and the value of the variable cannot change, ```let``` works from 2015 and the value of the variable cannot change.

All JavaScript **variables** must be identified with **unique names**. These unique names are called **identifiers**.

JavaScript can add strings and numbers: ```let x = "5" + 2 + 3;``` will get ```523```.
